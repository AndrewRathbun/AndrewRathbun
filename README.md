### Forked/Updated DFIR Tools

I enjoy finding abandoned DFIR tools/projects on GitHub and performing basic updates to keep them relevant and useful to the DFIR community. Check out all the tools I've forked and updated (to varying degrees) [here](https://github.com/stars/AndrewRathbun/lists/forked-updated-dfir-tools). If you have any ideas of tools or scripts that are long overdue for a tuneup, please let me know!

### Projects That Need Updating

If you think the [Forked/Updated DFIR Tools](https://github.com/stars/AndrewRathbun/lists/forked-updated-dfir-tools) list is cool, here is a list of tool repositories that may be transferred to that list someday! Think of this list as a to-do list for me to add more tools to the Forked/Updated DFIR Tools list. Check out my Projects That Need Updating list [here](https://github.com/stars/AndrewRathbun/lists/projects-that-need-updating).
